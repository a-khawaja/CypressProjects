Writing the tests

1. Go to integration folder and create a file of .js to write your test cases
2. Give /// <reference types = "cypress" /> 
3. After any change, simply save and cypress will re run the test. To disable this, go to cypress.json and set watchfForFileChanges: false. Also set "chromiumWebSecurity" : false

Structure of the test is as follow:

1. Create a page class for the webelements like the POM. 
2. To create the class, create a new folder under integration, name it as pages. 
3. Then create class using JS syntax.		
4. Inside the class, create the functions with the name of the elements, and return element CSS Selector from the function.	
5. At the end of the class, write export default ClassName.

6. Go to the test page of the class and import the page class, write import ClassName from '../PathToTheClass'
7. Write the test case, by writing describe keyword and use the arrow function to start. See the example in the cypress code. or below

			describe('Privacy Policy Text Verification', () =>{
				const homePage = new HomePage()
8. Create the object of the class you want to get the methods from	
	
	
	
	
	
it('test name', function (){
function and other things
})

To call the url use --> cy.visit
To get an element use --> cy.get
